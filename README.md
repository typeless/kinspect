# KInpect

A useless tool for examining processes information from kernel. The goal is to extend the stacktrace of kernel to userspace.

This was a one-off project for debugging a nasty issue. Now it's mostly useful as a working note about how ARM virtual memory/paging and ELF dynamic linking works.
